# ‚õ≥ The Golf Scorecard App

A full-stack iOS application to track golf scores, player stats, and round history. Designed and deployed under an agile workflow, this project earned **3rd Place in the NJIT Capstone Showcase**.
Due to the project being developed as part of a semester-long course, the codebase remains proprietary to the university, and I no longer retain direct access to the source repository.
